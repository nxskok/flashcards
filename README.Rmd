# flashcards

The goal of flashcards is to test my Welsh vocabulary.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `flashcards` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("nxskok/flashcards")
```
## Example

The package comes with a single function:

```{r example, eval = FALSE}
library(flashcards)
test_vocab()
```

It prompts you for the definition of a vocab word and gives three choices to choose from. For example, like this:

```
What does trwm mean? 

1: table
2: pharmacy
3: heavy

Selection: <enter your selection>
```

To be prompted with a vocab word every time you restart R, use `usethis::edit_r_profile()` to open your .Rprofile file for editing and add the following line:

``` r
if(interactive()) flashcards::test_vocab()
```

## Customizing the package

Want to test yourself on your own vocabulary? For the time being, the easiest way is the following:

1. Clone the repo
2. Replace `data-raw/vocab.tsv` with a tsv file of your choice. It should contain two columns with the following names: `test` (the word that is new to you) and `reference` (the definition)
3. Run the `vocab.R` script (edit if needed)
4. Run `devtools::install()` (or press "Install and Restart" in the Build pane in RStudio) to install the package locally
